# Doors Hands-Free

Opening doors without touching the doorknob or handle can reduce the risk of infection! This project started as a part of [#CodeVSCovid19](https://www.codevscovid19.org/) hackaton organized in an effort to fight the current `COVID-19` crisis

## Challenge

Under normal circumstances, we go about our lives, not noticing how many doors we are opening and closing in our daily routine. Public door knobs and handles are touched by many people, which makes them a high risk of contamination. In a time of the pandemic, doors have become obstacles: how can you open a door without touching a handle without an expensive electronic system?

## Solution

Hand sanitizers are hard to get; gloves are not practical; using tissues is wasteful. What could be the solution?

If we don't want to touch the door with our hands, then how about our feet? Sounds weird? Just so happens, we have been familiar with this solution for years:

**Yep, using our feet to press a pedal to open a door.!**

Using 3D printed parts, we are developing a prototype that can be easily installed on any door.
